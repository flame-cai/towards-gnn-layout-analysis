# COPYRIGHT NOTICE AND FAIR USE DECLARATION
All manuscript images and metadata referenced in this dataset are © Lalchand Research Library, DAV College, Chandigarh, India, and remain the exclusive property of the copyright holder. Original materials are made available by the copyright holder through the SPL Rare Books Digital Archive for educational and research purposes.

# IMPORTANT: This is a "Lazy Dataset" for Research and Educational Use Only
This dataset contains reference links only and does not host, redistribute, or republish any copyrighted content. We do not serve as a substitute for or competitor to the original archive. Users must access all manuscript images and metadata directly from the copyright holder's official platform.

# Fair Use Rationale (17 U.S.C. § 107)
This dataset is provided under the fair use doctrine for the following transformative, non-commercial purposes:
1) Transformative Research Purpose: This dataset serves as a benchmark to advance Graph Neural Network (GNN) based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) methodologies for historical manuscripts—a transformative scientific purpose that differs fundamentally from the original archival and preservation function of the source materials.
2) Educational and Research Use: The dataset facilitates academic research and education in machine learning, computer vision, and digital humanities—activities explicitly recognized under fair use.
3) No Market Substitution: We are not competitors to the Lalchand Research Library. This dataset does not diminish the market for or value of the original materials. It serves an entirely different purpose (algorithmic research) than the original archive (preservation and scholarly access to manuscripts).
4) Public Interest: Advancing OCR technology for historical manuscripts serves the broader public interest by improving accessibility of cultural heritage materials and enabling new forms of scholarship.
Minimal Reproduction: This lazy dataset contains only metadata and reference links, requiring users to interact directly with the copyright holder's platform to access any copyrighted content.
